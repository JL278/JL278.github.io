    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I am a first year at URI majoring in computer science. When I'm not working, I like to play video games. 
        Solving puzzles and exploring virtual worlds are some things I really enjoy. It's not just to pastime; 
        I also like connecting with friends online through gaming. On the other hand, I also like to keep active by going for runs. 
        Running helps me clear my mind and catch a breath of fresh air. Finding a balance between these two interests is a big part of who I am.
        It allows me to have the best of both worlds, whether I'm diving into virtual adventures or enjoying the great outdoors.</p>
