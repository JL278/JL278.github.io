<h1>Final Project</h1>
<p>For my final project CSC 106 I decided to make a coloring book along with my partner Kanz Giwa. In this coloring book,
     we incoprated 3 separate scenes that the user can interact with in order to fulfill the programs usage. The scene or 
     coloring pages include that of a food bowl, boba tea, as well as our initals in which the user can pick from a variety 
     of colors to color in the images. In this program there is also a selection page, where the user can pick any of the 3 
     pages they want to specifically color. Lastly there  is a Credits page which includes all of the contributors as well as 
     assets used in the making of this program. The purpose of the program that we made is targeted towards children as we designed 
     a coloring book with various images. This program is mainly seen as entertainment for children, but can also be used to help develop 
     their fine motor skills as they learn to identify various images.
